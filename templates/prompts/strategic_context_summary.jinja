# Strategic Context Summary

> This summary provides the complete strategic foundation for your product. Use it to evaluate new ideas, understand priorities, and ensure alignment with your roadmap.

---

## How to Use This Context

When evaluating a new idea, bug fix, or feature request, ask:
1. **Does this advance our vision?** If not, deprioritize or reject.
2. **Which pillar does this support?** Work should align with at least one strategic pillar.
3. **Which outcome does this move?** Prioritize work that advances measurable outcomes.
4. **Does this help our hero?** Keep the primary user's needs central.
5. **Does this defeat a villain?** Prioritize work that addresses real problems.

## Vision
{% if vision.vision_text|length > 0 %}
> {{ vision.vision_text }}

*Defined: {{ vision.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') if vision.created_at else 'Unknown' }}*
{% else %}
⚠️ **No vision defined yet.**

Your vision describes the change you want to make in the world—not what you're building, but why it matters. Consider defining one using `get_vision_definition_framework()`.
{% endif %}

---

## Strategic Pillars (How We Win)

Pillars are enduring choices that define HOW you'll achieve your vision. Each pillar should have a clear strategy AND anti-strategy (what you won't do).

{% if pillars %}
{% for pillar in pillars %}
### {{ pillar.identifier }}: {{ pillar.name }}

{{ pillar.description }}

{% endfor %}
{% if pillars|length < 2 %}
⚠️ **Only {{ pillars|length }} pillar(s) defined.** Consider defining 2-5 pillars for strategic clarity.
{% endif %}
{% else %}
⚠️ **No strategic pillars defined.**

Pillars explain your unique approach—what makes you different. Consider defining 2-5 pillars using `get_pillar_definition_framework()`.
{% endif %}

---

## Product Outcomes (Success Metrics)

Outcomes describe observable, measurable changes that indicate progress. They express IMPACT (what changed), not OUTPUT (what you shipped).

{% if outcomes %}
{% for outcome in outcomes %}
### {{ outcome.identifier }}: {{ outcome.name }}

{{ outcome.description }}

{% if outcome.pillar_names %}
**Linked Pillars:** {{ outcome.pillar_names|join(', ') }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% if outcomes|length < 2 %}
⚠️ **Only {{ outcomes|length }} outcome(s) defined.** Consider defining 2-3 outcomes to measure progress.
{% endif %}
{% else %}
⚠️ **No product outcomes defined.**

Outcomes define what success looks like—how you'll know your product is working. Consider defining 2-3 outcomes using `get_outcome_definition_framework()`.
{% endif %}

---

## Roadmap Themes (Current Bets)

Themes are strategic bet areas that organize your roadmap around problems to solve, not features to build. They sit in a 6-12 month horizon.

{% if themes %}
{% set prioritized_themes = themes|selectattr('is_prioritized')|list %}
{% set unprioritized_themes = themes|rejectattr('is_prioritized')|list %}

{% if prioritized_themes %}
### Prioritized Themes (Active Focus)

{% for theme in prioritized_themes|sort(attribute='priority_order') %}
#### {{ theme.identifier }}: {{ theme.name }} ⭐ Priority #{{ theme.priority_order + 1 }}

{{ theme.description }}

{% if theme.outcomes|length > 0 %}
**Advances Outcomes:** {{ theme.outcome|map(attribute="name")|join(', ') }}
{% else %}
**Advances Outcomes:** None set for this theme.
{% endif %}
{% if theme.heroes|length > 0 %}
**Helps:** {{ theme.heroes|map(attribute="name")|join(', ') }}
{% else %}
**Helps:** No hero set for this theme.
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
⚠️ **No themes are currently prioritized.** Consider prioritizing themes using `set_theme_priority()`.

{% endif %}

{% if unprioritized_themes %}
### Backlog Themes (Not Yet Prioritized)

{% for theme in unprioritized_themes %}
#### {{ theme.identifier }}: {{ theme.name }}

{{ theme.description }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% else %}
⚠️ **No roadmap themes defined.**

Themes represent your next focus areas—the hypotheses you want to test. Consider defining themes using `get_theme_exploration_framework()`.
{% endif %}

---

## Heroes (Who We're Building For)

Heroes are specific user personas with names, motivations, and real problems. They make strategy tangible.

{% if heroes %}
{% for hero in heroes %}
### {{ hero.identifier }}: {{ hero.name }}{% if hero.is_primary %} 👑 PRIMARY{% endif %}

{{ hero.description }}

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
⚠️ **No heroes defined.**

A hero is the specific person you're building for—give them a name and understand their world. Consider defining one using `get_hero_definition_framework()`.
{% endif %}

---

## Villains (Problems We're Fighting)

Villains are the obstacles blocking your heroes. They make problems concrete and memorable.

{% if villains %}
{% set active_villains = villains|rejectattr('is_defeated')|list %}
{% set defeated_villains = villains|selectattr('is_defeated')|list %}

{% if active_villains %}
### Active Villains

{% for villain in active_villains|sort(attribute='severity', reverse=True) %}
#### {{ villain.identifier }}: {{ villain.name }}
**Type:** {{ villain.villain_type }} | **Severity:** {{ '🔴' * villain.severity }}{{ '⚪' * (5 - villain.severity) }} ({{ villain.severity }}/5)

{{ villain.description }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if defeated_villains %}
### Defeated Villains ✅

{% for villain in defeated_villains %}
- ~~{{ villain.identifier }}: {{ villain.name }}~~ ({{ villain.villain_type }})
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% else %}
⚠️ **No villains defined.**

Villains represent the problems blocking your heroes. Consider defining one using `get_villain_definition_framework()`.
{% endif %}
